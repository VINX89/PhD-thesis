General: Very good. There are a lot of figures/tables that 'pile up' on otherwise blank pages or break the text. Not a problem now as this is a draft in progress but make sure you arrange them in the final draft. For the introductions to some of the chapters the motivation comes after a description of the work you did specifically. I wonder if these can be merged, as otherwise the first paragraph to each of these chapters is very sudden and misses context that comes later.

So far: no mention as yet of the scale of CPV in the SM, eg: via the Jarlskog invariant. I think it's worth mentioning that it isn't just deviation from unitarity that can signal NP, you might want to mention that we know from measurements of CPV that the amount we observe is insufficient to account for the amount of matter in the universe. This motivates measuring the UT. 

> Added

line 98: Up to now there hasn't been any motivation for measuring gamma. It's good to interest the reader by explaining that gamma is the least well measured angle, and theoretically the cleanest CKM angle: In order to look for NP in the UT we need to measure the apex cleanly and gamma is an important part of that. 

> Added

Line 115: I think 'lack of sensitivity' needs expanded, eg: This analysis is not sensitive to Cf /Cfbar because... and so they are fixed to +/-1.

Line 119: Rather than stating the expected yield I'd compare the BRs and production rates.

Line 123: You are an author of the DsK analysis- I think you should mention this somewhere if you don't already.

Line 125: Do you mention what Run 1 dataset means? I'd say using data collected at LHCb over the period 2010-2012.

Sec 2.2.1 general: Perhaps some performance plots/discussion should be included here? ie: What is the purpose of the tracking system, and is it good at it?  Things like momentum resolution, vertex and IP resolution would be interesting to include. This can be motivated by stating that the decay time resolution and rejection of prompt D+track are important for this analysis. 

> Small introduction and plots added.

265: There is a nice diagram that shows how different types of particle are separated by the PS, SPD, ECAL + HCAL. It helps non-experimentalists understand why we have these detectors. 

> Since the calorimeters are not really used neither for the Dpi analysis nor the flavour tagging (except for the Hlt1AllL0Decision trigger, maybe?), I would prefer to keep this section as small as possible.

284: detectors (plural) 

> Fixed

311: it's not all of the rest of the event necessarily, only some of it. Maybe reword to indicate that TIS means another signature in the event caused a trigger to accept it. 

> Rephrased

315: I'd change reconstructed to 'decays are reconstructed at higher quality than was possible in the strict timing requirements of the trigger, and further selections are applied' 

> Added

317: I'd motivate the existence of the L0 more here: The LHCb readout electronics is limited to 1MHz, and so a fixed-latency hardware stage is required. This must make fast decisions and so uses simple criteria that does not require reconstruction of the event.

Fig. 2.10: As this analysis is Run 1 only I think you can drop the 2nd figure. 

> The FT reoptimisation is actually performed on Run 2 data, so I prefer to leave the Run 2 trigger scheme as well.

384: and time-dependent CP asymmetries maybe? Not all CP asymmetries need FT.

Tab. 3.9 should come before Tab 3.7 so the reader knows what the variables mean

1559: There are some text formatting boxes in the axis labels. Also, the fit from which this is determined should be stated: (data, with constraints...)

Figs 47-50: I'd make it clear in the caption that the Gauss fit to the error is essentially meaningless unless the error is gaussian distributed.
