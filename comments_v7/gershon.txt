general notation

- write D-+pi+- consistently (not D+-pi-+ sometimes, as it is now)
- write B+ -> D0bar pi+, when you mean the Cabibbo-favoured mode 
(always, I believe), not B+ -> D0pi+

page 21 you state "The measured value of J is too small by several 
orders of magnitude to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry 
in the universe" however even if J was its maximum possible value, it 
would still not be possible to explain the BAU through SM CP violation. 
So the wording is not quite right.

on page 50 you state "many final states, such as D-+pi+-, are not CP 
eigenstates. This means that both B and BÌ„ mesons can decay to the same 
final state particles, ..."  But that's not what "not CP eigenstates 
means" -- in fact, if a state *is* a CP eigenstate then both B and Bbar 
can decay to it.  the point is just that the wording has got a bit confused

around Eq.3.13 (page 55), I think it would be helpful to explain clearly 
what the sum runs over (the use of the same index i in Eq.3.15 could 
confuse someone into thinking it is over different taggers, as happened 
for me)

page 65, sec 3.3.1, there is a "to" that should be "\to"

page 66 & Fig.3.8 -- comment in the text that many more cycles have been 
tested with no further improvement found

Figs.3.9-3.11 since it is hard to see any differences in the 1D 
distributions, it would be good to add some explanation of where the 
discrimination power comes from.  if there are 2D distributions that 
show this more clearly, consider adding them.
