%\subsubsection{Constrained parameters}
%\label{sec:time:prodasym}
The production asymmetry $A_{\mathrm{P}}$ between $\Bz$ and $\Bzb$ and the detection
asymmetry $A_{\mathrm{D}}$ are free parameters in the fit\footnote{The production
asymmetry is defined as $\frac{N(\Bzb)-N(\Bz)}{N(\Bzb)+N(\Bz)}$}. To verify the result, the value of the production asymmetry is obtained using the \lhcb measurement of the production asymmetry as a function of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity in $\Bz\to\jpsi\Kstz$ decays~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2014-042}. For that purpose the per-$p_T$-$\eta$-bin signal fractions $\varepsilon_i = \frac{f_i}{\sum_i f_i}$ of the nominal data set are
determined to calculate a weighted average of the production asymmetries,
%
\begin{equation}
	A_{\mathrm{P}} = \sum_i \varepsilon_i A_{\mathrm{P},i},
\end{equation}
%
where $f_i$ is the number of signal candidates and $A_{\mathrm{P},i}$ the
measured production asymmetry in bin $i$. This yields
%
\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:prodAsymm}
	%  \begin{split}
	A_{\mathrm{P}} =  -0.0124 \pm 0.0081\,\text{(stat)} \pm 0.0014\, \text{(syst)}.
	%  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%
Similarly, the detection asymmetry, $A_{D}$ is obtained from~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2014-042}
using $\Bz\to\jpsi\Kstz$ decays. The result is sufficiently similar to that obtained in
the note~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2014-042} for $\Bz\to\Dpm\pimp$ decays that we do not rebin.
%The value of the detection asymmetry is constrained in the fit to $A_{D}=(0.86\pm0.46)\%$.
%The production and detection asymmetries are correlated, with correlation coefficient -0.65~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2014-042}.

%We generate toys using these values for the baseline fit validation.
