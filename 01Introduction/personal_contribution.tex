\section{Personal contribution}
\label{sec:personal_contribution}

The analysis work presented in this thesis, published in Ref.~\cite{Aaij:2018kpq} 
has been carried out in close cooperation with LHCb members of the Technische Universit\"at of Dortmund.
My main responsibilities related to the $B^0\to D^{\mp}\pi^{\pm}$ analysis during my PhD time were:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]	
	\item opposite-side flavour tagging calibration (Sec.~\ref{sec:tagging:OScalib});
	\item correction of particle identification (Sec.~\ref{sec:pid});
	\item mass fit for \emph{sWeights} calculation (Sec.~\ref{sec:massfit});
	\item time-dependent analysis, in particular acceptance parameterisation (Sec.~\ref{sec:time:acc}), decay-time fit (Sec.~\ref{sec:datafit}), and estimation of systematic uncertainties (Sec.~\ref{sec:systematics}).
\end{itemize}
Moreover, I was responsible for:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
	\item calibration and performance studies of the LHCb Silicon Tracker (Sec.~\ref{sec:tracking}). The results of these studies are reported 
          in Ref.~\cite{spillover};
          \item monitoring and maintenance of the Silicon Tracker as on-call expert during data-taking operations (\emph{piquet});
	\item opposite-side electron tagger optimisation (Sec.~\ref{sec:tagging:OSeOpt}).
\end{itemize}
